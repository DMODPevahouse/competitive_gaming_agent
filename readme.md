This project was designed to create a simplified Starcraft Bot with limited actions to experiment with creating an AI agent that would match the skills of its opponent, improving, or devolving, as the other player skill fluxuates in order to create a competitive environment for learning regardless of skill, hoping to apply to other games as well to change how AI agents in games are designed as opposed to the typical easy, normal, hard, etc mindset.
