\begin{abstract}
    Deep reinforcement models in gaming is not entirely new, and in fact has performed quite well on many occasions, with Alphastar being one of the main contenders for high performance\cite{starcraft_unplugged}. This model was capable of overcoming
    99.6 percent of players, achieving one of the highest ranks with both and online and offline Reinforcement learning model. One avenue that has not been explored as deeply however, is using a model to be around the skill level of the opponent providing
    fun and challenging experience to a player regardless of the skill of the player. Most video games today still rely on a typical Easy, Medium, Hard difficulty level which ends up causing problems for both the low end of the spectrum and high end, meaning
    overly difficulty for the bottom players, and to easy for the higher skilled. The goal of this research is to prove the viability of a highly trained Reinforcement Model that's primary objective is not winning but giving a challenge to the opposing agent. This
    paper intends to focus on the novelty of an agent that changes its skill level to challenge its opponent but not to win at every chance.
